## Overview

This Git repository contains a Dropwizard microservice written in Java. This microservice serves as a bridge between your application and Salesforce, allowing you to interact with Salesforce data and services programmatically.

## Features

- **Salesforce Integration**: The microservice provides a set of APIs and endpoints to interact with Salesforce objects, such as leads, contacts, opportunities, and custom objects.

- **Authentication**: Secure authentication with Salesforce is implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access and interact with Salesforce data.

- **Data Retrieval**: You can use this microservice to retrieve data from Salesforce, whether it's for reporting, analytics, or any other data-related task.

- **Data Modification**: The microservice supports creating, updating, and deleting records in your Salesforce organization, providing you with full control over your Salesforce data.

- **Logging and Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error handling are implemented to provide visibility into the service's activities and to handle exceptions gracefully.
